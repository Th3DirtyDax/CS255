Systems Analysis and Design 


# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a client who sought to develop and online platform that woukd allow driver's education students to take various practice exams that would track their progress as they study and let them know where they need to improve. DriverPass also wanted to allow students to make appointments with DriverPass practical application instructors who could help the students with their on-the-road driving skills. Teachers could then leave important feedback notes to the students on their profiles. DriverPass would keep their information up-to-date through the DMV provided uopdates to rules, regulations, and policies. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well overall on the various diagrams that we were instructed to create for the project. I would like to revist a few of them and make modifications, however, overall I think that was where I did my best was with the organization of the diagrams. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to revise one part of the project I would probably revisit the Gantt Chart again. While I do like the one I created, there are small design and appearance adjustments I would like to adjsut. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By reviewing the interview and understanding everything the client wanted the system to do, I was able ensure that the system design allowed for the implementation of each of the key components that DriverPass mentioned they wanted their system to do. Taking notes and reviewing their requests was pertinent in ensuring that their wishes made it into the final system. 

It is important to consider the users need in a system design as the clients may present their overall idea for their system but they may not always know exactly what the user will need. We have the ones designing the system can then take the ideas and vision of the clients system and help turn it into something that the encapsulates the clients vision and needs of the users. This is important because if you do not consider the users needs in a system design then it could lead to user issues and displeased users once the system is completed. If the users cannot use the system or are highly displeases with it, then the system design was a failure. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to design software would be to get prototypes or early access versions that would allow for simple testing and user feedback to the ovlerall system before publishing a finalized version. This allows us to see what users like and dislike and what bugs and errors we may potentionally find and need to address. I would follow similar techniques we used in these projects. I would review the clients vision and discover the user needs of the system.
